Gameplay Instructions:
Launch from main menu, click play game, talk to the first Vulture. He will tell you to go forth and collect gems.
You will get to the main island at which a bird will tell you to continue to collect all the gems.
When you've collected all gems a cloud will appear between the hub island and a previously unreachable island, the bird will
congratulate you on beating the game.

head, it will die.
